JavaScript Operators
-------------------
1)Arithmetic Operators(+,-,*,**(exponent),/(division).(%modular division), ++(increment),--(decrement)
2)Assignment Operators(= eg x=y ,compound assignement operatoer += eg x+=y-->x=x+y (perform aritmetic operation and assigin to left side variable).
3)Comparison Operators(==(equal to),===(equal value and equal type),!=(not equal),!==(not equal value or not equal type),> (greater than),< less than,>= greater than or equal to, <= less than or equal to,? ternary operator)
4)Logical Operators (&&	logical and) (||logical or) (!	logical not)
5)JavaScript Type Operators (typeof  Returns the type of a variable)
6)JavaScript Bitwise Operators(& AND),(| OR),(~	NOT),(^	XOR),(<< left shift)(>>	right shift),(>>> unsigned right shift)--(when we use this)
7)terniary operator.
----------------
1)Arithmetic Operators -->this operator is mostly in accounts side.
3)comparison operator -->this operator give the output alway truE or false (it compare LHS=RHS). if condition is true enter into to block of code and next operartion or ifit is fales it execute else statement .this is mainly ised in condition and looping statements.
 eg:if (a>b).
4)Logical Operators-->by using operator we can check more contiond in single line.
0-->false.
" "-->empty string false.
a=10,b=5,c=20
eg if(a>b && a>c>) here it want to check both comparison operators (whwen we want this type of checking we go for logical operator.
-->a&&b AND True if both are true.
-->a || b OR True of either or both are true.
--> !a NOT True if a is false.
